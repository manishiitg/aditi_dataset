I would like you to help me generate prompts for a large language model to help train it in functional calling.

To accomplish this, I want you to generate 3 to 6 tools similar to below.

Example of tools:
[
  {
    "name": "search_recipe",
    "description": "Search for a recipe based on ingredients",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "ingredients": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "description": "The ingredients available"
        },
        "cuisine": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The cuisine type"
        },
        "diet": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The dietary restrictions"
        },
        "time": {
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "The maximum cooking time in minutes"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "ingredients"
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "convert_currency",
    "description": "Convert one currency to another",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "amount": {
          "type": "number",
          "description": "The amount to convert"
        },
        "from_currency": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The currency to convert from"
        },
        "to_currency": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The currency to convert to"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "amount",
        "from_currency",
        "to_currency"
      ]
    }
  }
]


The tools generated should be related to related to:
AWS IoT Analytics for data analysis


Tools generated should be in json format with "name", "description", "parameters", "required" as mandatory field.
Be sure to format the list of available functions as proper JSON, with appropriate spacing for nested objects.

Only responsed with the TOOLs json, don't include any placeholders text
