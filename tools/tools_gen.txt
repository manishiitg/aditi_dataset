I would like you to help me generate prompts for a large language model to help train it in functional calling.

To accomplish this, I want you to generate 3 to 6 tools similar to below.

Example of tools:
[
  {
    "name": "search_recipe",
    "description": "Search for a recipe based on ingredients",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "ingredients": {
          "type": "array",
          "items": {
            "type": "string"
          },
          "description": "The ingredients available"
        },
        "cuisine": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The cuisine type"
        },
        "diet": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The dietary restrictions"
        },
        "time": {
          "type": "integer",
          "description": "The maximum cooking time in minutes"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "ingredients"
      ]
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "convert_currency",
    "description": "Convert one currency to another",
    "parameters": {
      "type": "object",
      "properties": {
        "amount": {
          "type": "number",
          "description": "The amount to convert"
        },
        "from_currency": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The currency to convert from"
        },
        "to_currency": {
          "type": "string",
          "description": "The currency to convert to"
        }
      },
      "required": [
        "amount",
        "from_currency",
        "to_currency"
      ]
    }
  }
]
