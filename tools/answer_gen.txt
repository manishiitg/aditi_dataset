You are given a TOOLS defination.
You need to generate a relevent output based on users question using TOOLS in json format.

    You can only use a tool, when you have all parameter values. If you don't have values for all parameters, return "no_tools"
    Always ask user about missing parameter values.
    If there is no tool which fits the, reply with "no_tools"

    If you are selecting a TOOL, reply in the exact format
    {'arguments': <args-dict>, 'name': <function-name>}


Reply in format below:

Thought in English: think step by step about what to do in detail.
Action: the action to take if you have all tool parameter values, only one name of [{tool_names}], in the exact format {'arguments': <args-dict>, 'name': <function-name>}
Should Execute Action: do we have all parameter values to execute action reply only yes or no. If yes, i.e executing a tool reply to user should only contain a message asking user to wait.
Reply to User: a short natural language based message to be sent to the user

Question: How does the athlete's favorite color influence the performance analyzer's suggestions for stress management?


List of 5 TRICKY tasks generated:
TSK 1. For an athlete with a stress level of 7 out of 10, a focus duration of 45 minutes, and a recovery time of 120 minutes, what specific insights would the performance analyzer provide to improve their mental performance?
TSK 2. If an athlete has set a goal to increase their focus duration by 20% in the next 60 days, and they're currently at 60%, what is the target focus duration they should aim for, and when is the target date?
TSK 3. Given an athlete with an anxiety level of 8 on a scale of 10 and has tried deep breathing and positive self-talk as coping strategies, what novel coping mechanism could the coping_strategies tool suggest?
TSK 4. In a visualization session lasting 25 minutes, an athlete is visualizing a successful performance in a marathon. What specific details should the visualizacion_session guide include to enhance the effectiveness of the session?
TSK 5. An athlete with a goal to reduce their perceived stress level from 9 to 5 within a month has made 30% progress. Assuming the goal is linear, on what date would they reach their target stress level?

List of 5 tasks generated which might CONFUSE the agent:
TSK 1. How does the athlete's favorite color influence the performance analyzer's suggestions for stress management?
TSK 2. Can the goal_setting tool predict the exact outcome of an athletic competition based on the set goals?
TSK 3. In the coping_strategies tool, does the athlete's zodiac sign affect the recommended coping mechanisms for anxiety?
TSK 4. Does the duration of the visualization session in the visualizacion_session tool affect the athlete's physical fitness, rather than mental preparation?
TSK 5. Can the performance analyzer measure an athlete's emotional intelligence by analyzing their recovery time?

List of 5 tasks generated which don't require tools:
TSK 1. What are three common mental barriers that athletes might face during competition, and how can they overcome them?
