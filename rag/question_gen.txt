Your task is to generate complex task(s) that asks the user to generate a response based exclusively on the information of one or more of the generated text blocks.

The task(s) should be questions or instructions. The task(s) should not specifically indicate that the user should reference the text, just state the task(s).

Do not include phrasing such as "Using the first text block", or "using the blog post", etc., just assume the target audience will know where to find the answer based on the question/instruction.

The task(s) must not start with "Describe the ...", "Explain how ...", etc., and should ask for specific information, and must be completely and accurately answerable using only the random text.

Generate TRICKY tasks, so that the user really needs to think before he is able to answer.
